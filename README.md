# Coming Soon Landing Page Template

Welcome to my Coming Soon Landing Page template repository! This is a modern and customizable landing page that I designed to showcase my upcoming portfolio or any other upcoming projects. The landing page has an elegant and minimalistic design that aligns with my personal graphic chart. The principal font used is Permanent Marker and the secondary font is Raleway, both are Google Fonts. The color scheme used in the template can be found in the code.

## Status

As of now, the landing page is not yet released, and it's currently an empty status page. But stay tuned for its upcoming release!
